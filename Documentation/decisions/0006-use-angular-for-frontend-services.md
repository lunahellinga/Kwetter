# 6. Use Angular for frontend services

Date: 2023-05-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Given the team's expertise primarily lies in backend development using technologies like .NET Core, the choice of
Angular was driven by its similarity to programming languages such C#. This similarity minimizes the learning curve for
the team, allowing them to leverage their existing knowledge and skills to develop the frontend of Kwetter.

Moreover, Angular provides a structured and opinionated approach to frontend development. It offers a component-based
architecture, strong typing, and extensive tooling, making it easier for developers to build complex web applications.
Angular's component-based architecture aligns with the modular and scalable nature of Kwetter, enabling the team to
create reusable UI components and improve development efficiency.

Another advantage of Angular is its comprehensive documentation and active community support. This availability of
resources helps the team overcome any knowledge gaps and provides guidance on best practices, coding standards, and
troubleshooting. The wide adoption of Angular also ensures the availability of third-party libraries, UI components, and
extensions, further accelerating the development process.

## Decision

Angular was chosen as the frontend framework for Kwetter considering several factors, including the team's expertise and
the suitability of the framework for the project's requirements. The decision to use Angular was made after considering
the team's lack of front-end development expertise and the framework's alignment with the team's familiarity with
programming languages like .NET Core.

## Consequences

By choosing Angular for Kwetter's frontend services, the development team can leverage their existing expertise
with similar functioning frameworks to compensate for a lack of experience with frontend development. This results in a
reduced learning curve and improved productivity.
