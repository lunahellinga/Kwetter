# 9. Use Redis for caching kweets

Accepted

## Context

In the context of designing the Kweader Cache Service in Kwetter's architecture, we needed to select a suitable caching
solution to store and retrieve recent and high traffic kweets. The caching solution would enhance performance by
providing quick access to frequently accessed data and reducing the load on backend services.

## Decision

We decided to use Redis as the caching solution for the Kweader Cache Service:

1. In-Memory Data Store: Redis is an in-memory data store known for its exceptional performance and low latency. By
   leveraging Redis as a cache, we can store frequently accessed kweets in memory, resulting in faster retrieval times
   and improved overall system responsiveness.

2. Key-Value Store: Redis provides a simple and efficient key-value data model, which aligns well with the caching
   requirements of the Kweader Cache Service. Kweets can be stored and retrieved based on their unique keys, allowing
   for quick and direct access.

3. Expiration Policies: Redis offers flexible expiration policies that allow us to set a time-to-live (TTL) for cached
   kweets. This feature ensures that outdated kweets are automatically evicted from the cache, maintaining data
   freshness and reducing the storage footprint.

4. Scalability: Redis is designed to be highly scalable, enabling the cache to handle increased traffic and growing data
   volumes. It supports clustering and replication, allowing us to horizontally scale the caching infrastructure as
   needed.

5. Rich Feature Set: Redis provides additional features, such as data persistence options, pub/sub messaging, and
   support for various data structures. These features offer flexibility for future enhancements and potential use cases
   beyond caching in the Kwetter system.

## Consequences

The decision to use Redis as the caching solution for the Kweader Cache Service has the following consequences:

1. Improved Performance: By caching recent and high traffic kweets in Redis, we can significantly reduce the response
   time of the Kweader service. The in-memory nature of Redis enables faster data retrieval, enhancing the user
   experience and reducing the load on backend services.

2. Efficient Resource Utilization: Redis's ability to store data in memory allows for rapid access and reduces the need
   to query the underlying storage or compute resources for frequently accessed kweets. This optimizes resource
   utilization and improves overall system efficiency.

3. Additional Infrastructure Complexity: Incorporating Redis as a caching solution introduces additional infrastructure
   complexity. We need to set up and manage Redis clusters, configure replication, and ensure high availability and data
   durability.

4. Cache Consistency: Caching introduces the challenge of maintaining cache consistency with the underlying data source.
   We need to implement proper cache invalidation strategies and ensure that updates to kweets are reflected accurately
   in the cache.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance: Using Redis requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure its performance,
   availability, and proper data management. This includes monitoring memory usage, setting up backup and recovery
   processes, and managing Redis-specific configurations.
