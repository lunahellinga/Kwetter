## Introduction

Kwetter is a social media platform that allows registered users to share short messages called "Kweets" with a maximum length of 140 characters.
It is accessed through a web application and follows a microservice backend architecture.
Users can interact with Kweets by replying, sharing (rekweeting), and liking them.
Kweets may include mentions of other users and hashtags for tagging.
Users can follow other users to have their Kweets displayed in their timelines.
The platform also features a trend page showcasing popular topics based on tags used in Kweets.
Users have profile pages where they can set their profile picture, location, and status.
The app includes a search function for finding Kweets based on tags or users.
Users can mute specific tags to exclude related posts.
Users with moderator privileges can remove Kweets and ban users.
Administrators are responsible for granting moderator rights.

Kwetter was created as a project for Semester 6 at Fontys by David Hellinga.
