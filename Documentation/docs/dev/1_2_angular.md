## Coding Standards - Angular

The following coding standards provide guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and consistent code in Kwetter's
Angular projects, following the Angular Style Guide. Adhering to these standards will ensure code readability, improve
collaboration among developers, and enhance the overall quality of the codebase.

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, methods, classes, and components.
- Follow camelCase for variables, functions, and methods (e.g., myVariable, myFunction()).
- Use PascalCase for class and component names (e.g., export class MyComponent).
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., my-component.component.ts).

### Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation with a consistent tab width (e.g., 4 spaces).
- Use braces ({}) for block statements, even if the block contains a single line of code.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement, with a space before the opening brace.
- Use meaningful line breaks and indentation to improve code readability.

### Component Structure and Organization

- Separate component files into separate .ts, .html, and .scss files whenever possible.
- Use Angular's component decorator to define component metadata.
- Follow the recommended component structure: import statements, decorator, lifecycle hooks, public methods, private
- methods.

### Error Handling

- Use proper error handling techniques and display meaningful error messages to users.
- Implement error interceptors to handle HTTP errors globally.
- Log errors appropriately for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

### Comments and Documentation

- Include JSDoc comments for public methods and interfaces.
- Use comments to explain complex code logic, algorithms, or business rules.
- Avoid excessive comments that merely state the obvious.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for critical and complex code components using tools like Jasmine and Karma.
- Aim for high code coverage to ensure robust testing.
- Utilize Angular's testing utilities and frameworks effectively.

### Code Organization and Structure

- Organize code files logically into modules, components, and services.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and aim for small, focused components.
- Use appropriate access modifiers (public, private) to encapsulate functionality.
- Avoid long and complex functions and aim for methods with a single responsibility.

### Dependency Management

- Utilize Angular's dependency injection (DI) system to manage dependencies effectively.
- Follow the principle of Dependency Inversion, favoring abstractions over concrete implementations.

### Source Control and Git

- Use Git for version control and follow the Git branching model (e.g., GitFlow).
- Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- Review and test code changes before merging into the main branch.
