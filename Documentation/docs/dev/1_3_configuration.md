## YAML and Configuration File Standards

The following coding standards provide guidelines for writing clean, readable, and maintainable YAML and configuration
files in the Kwetter project. Adhering to these standards will ensure consistency, improve collaboration, and make it
easier to manage and maintain configuration files.

### Indentation and Formatting

- Use spaces for indentation instead of tabs.
- Maintain a consistent indentation level of 2 spaces.
- Separate key-value pairs with a colon and a space (e.g., key: value).
- Use hyphens for unordered lists and nested items.
- Align related key-value pairs vertically for better readability.
- Use double quotes for string values, unless they contain special characters.

### Comments and Documentation

- Use comments to provide explanations, clarify intent, or add context.
- Place comments on a new line above the code they reference.
- Keep comments concise and to the point.
- Avoid excessive commenting that repeats obvious information.

### Organization and Structure

- Organize configuration files logically based on their purpose or functionality.
- Group related configuration settings together.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for configuration files.
- Break down large configuration files into smaller, manageable sections or include separate files if supported.

### Reusability and Modularity

- Extract common configuration settings into reusable components or variables.
- Use YAML anchors (&) and aliases (*) to define and reference reusable blocks of code.

### Validation and Error Handling

- Ensure that configuration files are valid YAML syntax by using linting tools or parsers.
- Validate the configuration files against the expected structure or schema, if available.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to assist with troubleshooting.

### Security and Sensitive Information

- Avoid storing sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, directly in configuration files.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for storing sensitive configuration values.
- Ensure that sensitive configuration files are properly secured and accessible only to authorized personnel.

### Version Control and Review

- Store configuration files in version control systems, such as Git, for tracking changes.
- Follow established version control practices, such as proper branching and merging workflows.
- Conduct code reviews of configuration changes to ensure quality and consistency.

### Documentation

- Include a README file in the project repository that provides an overview of the configuration files, their purpose,
  and any specific instructions or considerations.
