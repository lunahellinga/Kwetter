## Security Incident Management

### Objective

The objective of this Security Incident Management Service Level Agreement (SLA) is to establish clear guidelines and
procedures for handling security incidents in Kwetter. It ensures that security incidents are promptly identified,
assessed, and managed with the appropriate level of urgency and severity, following ITILv4 best practices.

### Security Incident Management Process

1. Identification: Security incidents are identified through proactive monitoring, incident reports, security tools, or
   user reports.
2. Assessment: The Incident Manager assesses the impact, severity, and scope of the security incident to determine the
   appropriate priority level.
3. Containment and Mitigation: Immediate measures are taken to contain the incident, mitigate the impact, and prevent
   further exploitation or damage.
4. Investigation: A thorough investigation is conducted to gather evidence, identify the root cause, and determine the
   extent of the incident.
5. Resolution: The incident is resolved by applying appropriate remediation measures, such as patching vulnerabilities,
   updating configurations, or implementing security controls.
6. Communication: Timely and accurate communication is maintained throughout the incident lifecycle to keep stakeholders
   informed about the incident status, impact, and progress.
7. Escalation: Incidents are escalated to higher management or specialized teams based on the predefined priority levels
   and escalation protocols.
8. Closure: Once the incident is resolved and all necessary actions are taken, the incident is officially closed, and a
   post-incident review may be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve future incident response capabilities.

| P1       | Critical security incidents that have an immediate and severe impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Kwetter's systems or data. Examples include a successful data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or a widespread malware infection. | - Incident Manager will be notified immediately. <br> - Incident Manager will engage the Security Officer within 30 minutes.   |
| P2       | High impact security incidents that require urgent attention but do not pose an immediate threat to the core functionalities of Kwetter. Examples include a system vulnerability exploitation, a significant DDoS attack, or an unauthorized change to critical configurations.   | - Incident Manager will be notified within 30 minutes. <br> - Incident Manager will engage the Security Officer within 1 hour. |
| P3       | Security incidents with moderate impact that may disrupt normal operations or have potential vulnerabilities. Examples include a brute force attack on user accounts, a minor data leakage, or a low-level security policy violation.                                             | - Incident Manager will be notified within 2 hours. <br> - Incident Manager will engage the Security Officer within 4 hours.   |

### Communication

During the security incident management process, the following communication channels are utilized:

1. Incident Reporting: Incidents are reported through the designated incident reporting channels, such as incident
   management tools or dedicated email addresses.
2. Notification: Incident notifications are sent to the Incident Manager, Security Officer, and other relevant
   stakeholders to initiate the incident response process.
3. Updates: Regular updates are provided to stakeholders regarding the incident status, progress, and any significant
   developments.
4. Closure Notification: Once the incident is resolved and closed, stakeholders are notified of the closure and any
   necessary follow-up actions.

### Closure

The closure of a security incident involves the following steps:

1. Validation: The Incident Manager validates that all necessary actions have been taken to mitigate the incident and
   prevent recurrence.
2. Documentation: Relevant information, evidence, and actions taken during the incident response are documented for
   future reference and audit purposes.
3. Post-Incident Review: A post-incident review may be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the incident response
   process, identify areas for improvement, and implement necessary changes.
