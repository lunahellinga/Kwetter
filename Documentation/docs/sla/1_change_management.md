## Change Management

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the guidelines and expectations for change management in Kwetter, following
the ITILv4 (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) framework. Change management aims to implement changes to
Kwetter's environment in a controlled and efficient manner while minimizing risks and disruptions.

### Objective

The objective of this SLA is to define the change management process, establish clear priorities for different types of
changes, assign responsibilities to appropriate teams, and ensure effective communication throughout the change
implementation.

### Change Management Process

1. Change Request Submission: Changes should be initiated by submitting a change request using the designated change
   management system. The change request should include detailed information such as the nature of the change, its
   purpose, expected benefits, risks, required resources, and a proposed implementation plan.

2. Change Categorization and Prioritization: Changes should be categorized based on their nature and potential impact.
   The following priorities are defined:

    - Priority 1 (Critical): Changes that have a significant impact on business operations, involve critical system
      components, or introduce major security enhancements.
    - Priority 2 (High): Changes that have a noticeable impact on business operations or infrastructure, such as updates
      to core functionalities or system enhancements.
    - Priority 3 (Normal): Changes that have a minor impact on business operations or affect individual components, such
      as bug fixes or minor feature additions.
3. Change Evaluation and Approval: Changes should undergo a thorough evaluation process to assess their feasibility,
   risks, and potential impacts. The Change Advisory Board (CAB) or the designated Change Manager should review and
   approve changes based on their priority, urgency, and alignment with business objectives.

4. Change Planning and Implementation: Approved changes should be planned in detail, including identifying the
   responsible team(s) and allocating the necessary resources. A clear implementation plan should be developed,
   documenting the steps, timelines, and any dependencies or prerequisites for successful change deployment.

5. Change Review and Closure: After the change has been implemented, a post-implementation review should be conducted to
   evaluate its success, verify the desired outcomes, and identify any lessons learned. The change should be formally
   closed, and the relevant documentation should be updated accordingly.

### Change Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Impact                                                                                                                 | Urgency                                                             |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P1       | Significant impact on business operations, critical system components, or major security enhancements.                 | Immediate attention and implementation required.                    |
| P2       | Noticeable impact on business operations or infrastructure, such as core functionality updates or system enhancements. | High urgency, requiring prompt implementation.                      |
| P3       | Minor impact on business operations or individual components, such as bug fixes or minor feature additions.            | Reasonable implementation timeframe based on the change complexity. |
