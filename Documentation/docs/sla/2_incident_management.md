## Incident Management

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the guidelines and expectations for incident management in Kwetter,
following the ITILv4 (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) framework. Incident management aims to restore
normal service operations as quickly as possible and minimize the impact on business operations.

### Objective

The objective of this SLA is to define the incident management process, prioritize incidents based on their impact and
urgency, and establish appropriate escalation protocols to ensure timely resolution and effective communication.

### Incident Management Process

1. Incident Identification and Logging: Incidents should be identified and logged by users, administrators, or automated
   monitoring systems. Incidents should be recorded with accurate and detailed information, including the date, time,
   affected service, description of the incident, and any relevant attachments or screenshots.

2. Initial Assessment and Prioritization: Incidents should be assessed to determine their impact and urgency. The
   following priorities are defined:
    - Priority 1 (Critical): Incidents that have a severe impact on business operations, result in a complete service
      outage, or pose significant security risks.
    - Priority 2 (High): Incidents that have a noticeable impact on business operations or affect a significant number
      of users.
    - Priority 3 (Normal): Incidents that have a minor impact on business operations or affect individual users.

3. Incident Escalation: For Priority 1 incidents, the following escalation protocol should be followed:
    - First Line Support: The incident should be initially assigned to the First Line Support team responsible for
      immediate investigation and initial resolution attempts.
    - Second Line Support: If the incident cannot be resolved by the First Line Support team within the defined
      timeframe, it should be escalated to the Second Line Support team, who possess advanced technical expertise and
      resources.
    - Third Line Support: If the incident remains unresolved or requires further escalation, it should be escalated to
      the Third Line Support team, which may include specialized engineers or vendors.

4. Incident Resolution and Communication: The incident management team should work diligently to investigate, diagnose,
   and resolve incidents within the defined resolution timeframes for each priority level. Throughout the process,
   regular communication should be maintained with the affected users, keeping them informed of the progress and
   expected resolution times.

5. Incident Closure and Documentation: Once an incident is resolved, it should be formally closed in the incident
   management system, documenting the actions taken, root cause analysis (if applicable), and any necessary follow-up
   actions or recommendations.

| Priority | Impact                                                                                        | Urgency                                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P1       | Severe impact on business operations, complete service outage, or significant security risks. | Immediate attention and resolution required.                                            |
| P2       | Noticeable impact on business operations or affecting a significant number of users.          | High urgency, requiring prompt resolution.                                              |
| P3       | Minor impact on business operations or affecting individual users.                            | Reasonable resolution timeframe based on the incident severity and available resources. |
