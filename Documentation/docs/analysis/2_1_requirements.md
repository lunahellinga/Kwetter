## Requirements

Requirements for Kwetter can be split into two primary categories: Functional and Non-Functional requirements..
In addition to these, we can also define a set of requirements that stem from Kwetter's origin as a school project, but these will not be detailed in the project documentation and can be found in the reading guide provided in the portfolio.

**Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements define the specific behaviors, features, and capabilities that a software system must possess to meet the needs of its users.
These requirements describe what the system should do and how it should behave in response to user actions or input.
They are typically derived from user stories, use cases, or stakeholder interviews.
Functional requirements answer questions such as "What tasks should the system perform?" and "How should the system respond to user interactions?".

Functional requirements are essential for determining the core functionalities of the software system and serve as a basis for design, development, and testing activities.
They provide a clear roadmap for implementing the desired behaviors and features of the application.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes and constraints that the software system must adhere to.
Unlike functional requirements, which focus on what the system should do, non-functional requirements emphasize how the system should perform and behave.
These requirements address aspects such as security, performance, reliability, usability, scalability, maintainability, and regulatory compliance.

Non-functional requirements often serve as criteria for evaluating the overall quality and effectiveness of the software system.
They set expectations for system performance, user experience, and other critical factors that contribute to the system's success.
Non-functional requirements are typically derived from industry standards, organizational policies, legal regulations, or specific user needs.

Non-functional requirements guide architectural decisions, infrastructure planning, and quality assurance efforts.
They ensure that the system meets certain standards and expectations beyond its core functionality, enhancing user satisfaction, system reliability, and overall software quality.
