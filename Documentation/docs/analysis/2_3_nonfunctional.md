      fixes.

13. ITIL v4 Compliant Change Management
    - Changes to the application and its infrastructure should follow the ITIL v4 change management principles.
    - Proper documentation, approval workflows, and testing procedures should be in place for efficient and controlled
      change implementation.

14. Automation and Monitoring for Security and Scalability
    - Automated security measures, such as intrusion detection systems and firewall configurations, should be
      implemented to protect the platform from unauthorized access and attacks.
    - Continuous monitoring should be performed to identify and respond to security threats promptly.
    - Scalability should be achieved through automation, allowing the system to dynamically scale resources based on
      demand.
