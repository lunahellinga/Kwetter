## Misuse Cases

Unauthorized Access:

- **Misuse Case**: An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive data.
- **Mitigation**: We enforce strong authentication measures, such as password hashing and salting, as well as supporting
  multifactor authentication (MFA). Additionally, we implement robust access control mechanisms, role-based
  permissions, and regular security audits to detect and prevent unauthorized access.

Information Leakage:

- **Misuse Case**: Sensitive user information or Kweet data is exposed to unauthorized individuals.
- **Mitigation**: We employ encryption techniques to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit. Access controls and
  proper authentication mechanisms are implemented to limit data access to authorized individuals only. Regular security
  assessments and vulnerability scans are conducted to identify and address any potential information leakage risks.
  Measures are taken to ensure developers do not have access to sensitive data and configurations are stored securely.

Malicious Content:

- **Misuse Case**: Users attempt to post malicious content, spam, or abusive messages on the platform.
- **Mitigation**: We implement content filtering mechanisms, such as profanity filters and spam detection algorithms, to
  automatically detect and remove malicious or inappropriate content. Users can report abusive content, which triggers a
  moderation process to review and take necessary actions, such as warning, suspending, or banning offending accounts.

Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:

- **Misuse Case**: Attackers attempt to overwhelm the Kwetter platform with a high volume of requests, causing a service
  disruption.
- **Mitigation**: We employ rate limiting and request throttling techniques to prevent DoS attacks. Load balancers,
  caching mechanisms, and scalable infrastructure are utilized to handle increased traffic and maintain system
  availability.

Account Hijacking:

- **Misuse Case**: Attackers attempt to gain control of user accounts and impersonate legitimate users.
- **Mitigation**: We implement strong password policies, encourage users to enable MFA, and regularly educate users
  about best practices for maintaining account security. Suspicious login activities trigger alerts and account
  lockouts, ensuring proactive measures are taken to prevent account hijacking.
