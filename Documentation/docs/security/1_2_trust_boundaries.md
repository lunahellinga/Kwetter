## Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries in software systems refer to the separation between components or services that are considered trusted
and those that are not. They establish a line of demarcation that helps define the scope of trust and security measures
within a system. We employ trust boundaries to differentiate between the components that fall within the boundary and
those
that do not. This allows us to focus security efforts on protecting the trusted components and implementing appropriate
measures to ensure data integrity and system security.

Within Kwetter, the web-applications KwetterWeb is considered a trusted component and falls within the trust boundary.
It
is developed and maintained with strict security practices, adhering to secure coding standards, and undergoing rigorous
security assessments. KwetterWeb is designed to handle user interactions, provide functionality such as posting Kweets,
interacting with other users, and managing user profiles. This web-applications is considered reliable, secure, and
subject to stringent security controls.

On the other hand, the Single Page Application (SPA) that users interact with does not fall within the trust boundary.
The SPA is executed on the client-side within the user's web browser. It is important to recognize that the SPA is
considered an untrusted component from a security perspective. It is vulnerable to client-side attacks, manipulation,
and unauthorized access. As such, we must take appropriate precautions to mitigate risks associated with the untrusted
nature of the SPA.

To address this, we implement several security measures:

- Authentication and Authorization: Users are required to authenticate themselves using secure mechanisms, such as
  username/password or multifactor authentication, to access the Kwetter system. Authorization controls are in place to
  restrict user actions and access to specific resources.

- Secure API Design: We follow secure API design principles to prevent unauthorized access and protect against common
  web-application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Input
  validation, output encoding, and secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) are implemented to ensure data integrity
  and confidentiality.

- Security Monitoring: We employ logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious activities or
  security breaches. This allows us to identify potential threats and take appropriate actions in a timely manner.

- Regular Security Audits: We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to assess the overall security
  posture of the system, identify vulnerabilities, and address any security weaknesses promptly.
