## Security Monitoring

To implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for security monitoring in Kwetter, we have
chosen to utilize DataDog. DataDog offers a robust platform that combines log management, monitoring, and security
capabilities. Here's how we will leverage DataDog to enhance our security monitoring:

### Log Collection and Aggregation:

- DataDog provides seamless integration with various log sources, allowing us to collect and aggregate logs from
  different components of our infrastructure, such as servers, containers, and applications.
- We will configure DataDog to ingest logs from relevant systems and services in Kwetter, ensuring comprehensive
  coverage of our log data.

### Real-time Log Analysis and Alerting:

- DataDog's SIEM functionality enables real-time log analysis, utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning
  algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of security incidents.
- We will define custom log analysis rules and alerting criteria based on security best practices and specific threat
  scenarios relevant to Kwetter.

### Threat Detection and Response:

- DataDog's SIEM capabilities provide pre-built threat detection rules and security monitoring templates, covering a
  wide range of common security issues and attack patterns.
- We will leverage these pre-built rules and customize them to align with the specific security requirements of Kwetter.
- Any suspicious activities or potential security incidents identified by DataDog will trigger alerts for immediate
  investigation and response.

### Dashboarding and Visualization:

- DataDog offers powerful dashboarding and visualization features, allowing us to create custom security monitoring
  dashboards to gain real-time insights into our system's security posture.
- We will design and configure dashboards to display relevant security metrics, event trends, and other key indicators,
  enabling us to monitor and assess the overall security health of Kwetter.

### Integration with Incident Response Workflow:

- DataDog can integrate with our existing incident response workflow, facilitating seamless collaboration and efficient
  incident management.
- Incident alerts generated by DataDog can be automatically routed to the appropriate teams and individuals responsible
  for incident response, ensuring timely and coordinated actions.
