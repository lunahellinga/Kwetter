## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Scans

As part of our comprehensive security approach, we have integrated Snyk and SonarCloud into our CI/CD pipeline to scan
for vulnerabilities in our code and dependencies. These tools help us proactively identify and remediate security issues
at an early stage of the development process.

Additionally, we utilize AWS Whisper security scans to catch vulnerabilities locally during the development phase. This
allows us to detect and address any security weaknesses in our infrastructure configurations, ensuring a robust and
secure environment for our application.

### Penetration Testing

Furthermore, we are actively exploring the possibility of incorporating automated penetration testing into our security
practices. Automated pentesting tools can simulate real-world attacks, helping us identify potential weaknesses and
vulnerabilities in our system. By conducting automated pentests, we can continuously assess the security posture of our
application and implement necessary safeguards to protect against potential threats.
