## Tech Options

Scalability: Technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS Auto Scaling can help with managing and scaling microservices. Load balancers such as Nginx or HAProxy can also help to distribute traffic effectively.

Security: Technologies such as OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and SSL/TLS can help to secure user authentication and data transfer. Firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can also be used to protect against attacks.

Reliability: Technologies like Redis, RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka can be used to implement redundant microservices and ensure high availability through failover mechanisms. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI can also help to automate deployments and reduce downtime.

Performance: Technologies like caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) can help to improve the performance of microservices. High-performance databases like MongoDB or Cassandra can also be used to store and retrieve data quickly.

Maintainability: Technologies like microservices frameworks (e.g. Spring Boot or Micronaut) and container orchestration tools (e.g. Kubernetes) can help to modularize microservices and make them easier to maintain. Version control systems like Git can also help to manage changes and rollbacks.

Extensibility: Technologies like API gateways (e.g. Apigee or Kong) can help to manage and expose microservice APIs, making it easier to integrate with other services or applications. Message brokers like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ can also be used for event-driven architectures, which can help to enable extensibility.

Monitoring and Logging: Technologies like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can be used to monitor and log key performance metrics and events in real-time. This can help to quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact users.
