## Reflection

Throughout these research projects, I have gained valuable insights and learned important lessons that will shape my
approach in future projects. One significant lesson I learned was the need to balance the focus on details and the
ability to zoom out and see the bigger picture.

At the beginning of the research projects, I found myself getting caught up in the technical details and intricacies of
the various technologies and methodologies. This focus on details resulted in spending a significant amount of time on
specific aspects without fully considering the overall objectives and requirements. It became clear that I needed to
step back and take a broader perspective.

Gradually, I managed to zoom out and refocus on the overarching goals of the projects. This shift in mindset allowed me
to see the research questions from a more holistic standpoint, considering not only the technical aspects but also the
practical implications and impact on the desired outcomes. It was a valuable lesson in striking a balance between
attention to detail and maintaining a broader perspective.

Another area where I encountered challenges was in transitioning from research and exploration to the testing stage.
While I conducted extensive research and explored different technologies and methodologies, I realized that I took
longer than expected to move to the testing phase. It was important to recognize that research alone is not sufficient,
and practical validation through testing is crucial for gaining empirical evidence and validating the effectiveness of
the chosen approaches.

Furthermore, I observed that I tend to focus heavily on conducting research and gathering information but face
challenges when it comes to documenting and articulating the findings effectively. Although I gained valuable knowledge
through research, I realized that the true value lies in the ability to communicate and present that knowledge to
stakeholders and team members. This realization highlighted the importance of improving my skills in synthesizing and
documenting research findings concisely and effectively.

To address these challenges, I acknowledge the need to allocate sufficient time for testing and validation in future
projects. Additionally, I will work on improving my ability to communicate and document research findings in a clear and
concise manner. By enhancing these skills, I will be able to effectively convey the outcomes of my research and ensure
that the insights gained can be utilized by stakeholders and team members.
