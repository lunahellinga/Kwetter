## Summary

In summary, the development of Kwetter, a microservices-based platform, has involved careful consideration and
evaluation of various technologies to meet specific requirements. The chosen technologies, including an nginx ingress
for API management, RabbitMQ as the message broker, and Cilium as the service mesh, demonstrate suitability for
Kwetter's needs. However, further configuration and utilization of scaling options within the cluster are required to
fully capitalize on their potential.

The decision to use an nginx ingress with a self-made API behind it enables effective service exposure without relying
on a dedicated API gateway solution. However, implementing horizontal pod autoscaling and traffic splitting can optimize
the gateway's performance and resource utilization.

RabbitMQ was selected as the message broker due to its ease of use and compatibility with the MassTransit messaging
library. To fully leverage RabbitMQ's scalability benefits, configuring a RabbitMQ cluster, employing queue
partitioning, and utilizing features like publisher confirms and acknowledgments are necessary to handle larger data
streams and higher message throughput.

The adoption of the Cilium service mesh provides advanced networking and security features. However, additional
configuration options, such as automatic sidecar injection, traffic routing policies, and utilizing telemetry and
observability features, can further enhance the service mesh's capabilities within the Kwetter cluster.

By implementing these configurations, Kwetter will be well-equipped to handle increased user traffic, scale resources
dynamically, and optimize performance. This will ensure that the chosen technologies operate at their full potential,
delivering the desired scalability, reliability, and performance benefits to the Kwetter platform.
