## Conclusion

**What is needed to ensure the integrity and retention of Kweets?**

In conclusion, the requirements for Kwetter's database solution involve considerations such as data storage, data
integrity, data retention, scalability, backup and disaster recovery, security and privacy, cost, and caching.

ACID compliance is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially for critical operations like posting Kweets,
updating profiles, and managing follower relationships. Relational databases are well-suited for providing ACID
guarantees.

To facilitate features such as viewing past Kweets and analyzing trends, Kwetter requires a mechanism to retain the
history of Kweets and user profiles. This can involve archiving older Kweets or maintaining a versioning mechanism in
the database.

Scalability considerations are essential as Kwetter aims to mimic a popular social media platform. Distributed database
systems like CockroachDB, TiDB, or YugabyteDB can provide horizontal scalability through automatic sharding and
replication.

Regular database backups and a disaster recovery plan are necessary to ensure data safety. Cloud-based database services
like AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, or Google Cloud SQL can provide scalability and managed services within a budget.

Security measures, such as encryption, secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and compliance with data
protection regulations, need to be implemented to protect user data.

Caching can be utilized to improve read operation performance. Implementing a caching layer using technologies like
MongoDB, Memcached, or Redis can help store frequently accessed data in memory for fast retrieval. Cache invalidation
mechanisms and appropriate caching strategies should be employed to maintain data consistency and relevancy.

Based on performance testing, MongoDB emerged as the optimal choice for small-scale unstructured data, while Postgres
demonstrated superior performance with large datasets and sorting operations. Neo4j showed lower performance, primarily
suited for complex relationship analytics. Yugabyte's performance tests had different conditions, and sharded databases
can be considered based on specific requirements.

By considering these requirements and test results, Kwetter can make informed decisions about the appropriate database
systems to utilize for specific functionalities, striking a balance between functionality and cost.
