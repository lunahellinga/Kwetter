## Technologies

Ensuring the integrity and retention of Kweets on the Kwetter platform requires robust technologies for managing large
volumes of data. In this section, we will explore various technologies commonly used for data retention, considering
their scalability, performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The information presented here is based on an
extensive review of existing literature and industry practices.

### Database Systems

Database systems are fundamental components for storing and managing large volumes of data. When it comes to data
retention, the following technologies are worth considering:

#### Relational Databases

Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle
Database offer robust data retention capabilities. They provide transactional integrity, support for ACID properties,
and reliable backup and recovery mechanisms. However, they may face challenges with scalability and handling
unstructured data. [What is a relational database? (n.d.).]

Upsides:

- Strong Data Integrity: Relational databases provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties,
  ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- Mature Technology: Relational databases have been widely used for decades, resulting in a mature ecosystem, robust
  tooling, and comprehensive community support.
- Complex Querying: SQL (Structured Query Language) allows for complex queries, joins, and aggregations, making it
  suitable for complex data analysis.

Downsides:

- Limited Scalability: Relational databases can face scalability challenges, especially with large datasets and high
  write-intensive workloads. Scaling vertically (adding more resources to a single server) can be costly.
- Schema Rigidity: The predefined schemas of relational databases can be inflexible, making it challenging to handle
  unstructured or rapidly evolving data.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Heavy write loads, complex joins, and high concurrency can lead to performance bottlenecks,
  requiring careful database design and query optimization.

1. Oracle Database: Oracle Database is a leading enterprise-grade relational database management system. It offers
   robust features for data integrity, scalability, security, and high availability. [Cost-optimized and High-Performance Database. (n.d.).]

2. MySQL: MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database that is known for its performance, scalability, and
   ease of use. It is suitable for various applications, ranging from small projects to large-scale
   deployments. [MySQL. (n.d.).]

3. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system known for its extensibility, support for
   advanced features, and compliance with SQL standards. It provides strong data integrity, reliability, and a wide
   range of extensions. [PostgreSQL. (2023, June 4).]

#### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase, excel in handling large volumes of
unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer horizontal scalability, high availability, and flexible schema
designs. NoSQL databases are suitable for scenarios where real-time processing and scalability are
essential.  [What are NoSQL Databases? | IBM. (n.d.).]

Upsides:

- Scalability: NoSQL databases excel in horizontal scalability, allowing for easy distribution of data across multiple
  nodes, making them suitable for handling large-scale and high-traffic applications.
- Flexible Data Models: NoSQL databases offer various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, wide-column,
  and graph, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate model for their data.
- High Performance: NoSQL databases prioritize performance and can handle large volumes of read and write operations
  with low-latency responses.

Downsides:

- Limited Transaction Support: NoSQL databases typically sacrifice some transactional consistency in favor of high
  scalability and performance, making them less suitable for applications that require strong transactional guarantees.
- Limited Querying Options: NoSQL databases may have limited querying capabilities compared to SQL in relational
  databases. Querying is often based on key-value lookups or document-centric queries, which can be less expressive for
  complex data analysis.
- Lack of Standardization: The NoSQL landscape encompasses a wide range of databases with different APIs, query
  languages, and data models. This lack of standardization can lead to compatibility issues and increased complexity
  when working with multiple NoSQL databases.

1. MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of
   development. It allows for the storage of JSON-like documents and provides powerful querying
   capabilities. [MongoDB. (n.d.).]
2. Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database. It offers excellent write and read
   performance, fault tolerance, and linear scalability. Cassandra is suitable for handling massive amounts of data
   across multiple data centers. [Apache Cassandra | Apache Cassandra Documentation. (n.d.).]
3. Couchbase: Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL database that combines key-value and document-oriented approaches. It
   provides a flexible data model, high availability, and powerful caching mechanisms. [Couchbase: Best NoSQL Cloud Database Service. (2023, June 2). ]

#### NewSQL Databases

NewSQL databases, like CockroachDB and Spanner, aim to combine the best of both worlds by providing
the scalability of NoSQL systems while retaining some ACID properties of traditional databases. They are well-suited
for applications requiring strong consistency, distributed transactions, and
scalability. [Dancuk, M. (2023).]

Upsides:

- Scalability: NewSQL databases offer horizontal scalability, allowing for distributed architectures and the ability to
  handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
- ACID Compliance: Unlike many NoSQL databases, NewSQL databases strive to maintain ACID properties, ensuring
  transactional consistency and integrity even in distributed environments.
- Familiar SQL Interface: NewSQL databases typically support SQL, making it easier for developers familiar with
  relational databases to transition to these systems without having to learn new query languages or paradigms.
- Distributed Transactions: NewSQL databases provide mechanisms for distributed transactions, allowing transactions to
  span across multiple nodes and ensuring data consistency across the distributed environment.

Downsides:

- Maturity and Ecosystem: NewSQL databases are relatively newer compared to traditional relational databases and NoSQL
  databases. As a result, they may have a smaller community, less mature tooling, and a narrower ecosystem of libraries
  and frameworks.
- Limited Adoption and Vendor Options: The number of NewSQL database vendors and available options may be more limited
  compared to the established relational and NoSQL database ecosystems.
- Trade-offs in Consistency and Latency: Achieving strong consistency and low-latency performance in distributed
  environments is a challenging task. NewSQL databases may require trade-offs in consistency levels or latency to
  maintain scalability and performance.

     > workload across multiple nodes. This parallel processing can lead to improved query performance and reduced
     response
     > times compared to traditional relational databases.
>
> 4. Complexity: Sharded databases introduce additional complexity due to the need for data partitioning, distributed
     > queries, and managing data consistency across shards. While vendors aim to handle most of this complexity inside
     the
     > database, designing and maintaining a sharded database still requires more planning and coordination.
>
> 5. Schema Flexibility: Sharded databases often provide schema flexibility, allowing for dynamic changes to the data
     > model without impacting the entire system. This flexibility is beneficial in dynamic environments where data
     > structures evolve rapidly.
>
> 6. Querying and Transactions: Sharded databases may have limitations in querying capabilities, especially when complex
     > joins or aggregations involve data from multiple shards. Distributed transactions can also be more challenging to
     > implement and maintain in sharded environments.
