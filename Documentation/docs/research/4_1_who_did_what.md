## Who did What?

In the initial plan, the research projects were intended to be conducted collaboratively with a team member. However,
unforeseen circumstances arose when the team member I was originally planning to work with stopped showing up early on
in the process. This unexpected situation disrupted the planned collaboration and required me to adapt and continue the
research projects independently.

The absence of a team member to share the workload and collaborate on the research presented additional challenges. It
meant that I had to rely solely on my own skills, knowledge, and perspectives throughout the research process. The lack
of diverse viewpoints and complementary expertise could have impacted the quality and depth of the research. However, I
strived to compensate for this by seeking external feedback, consulting experts in relevant domains, and continuously
validating my findings and assumptions.

By the time the teams merged, I had already made significant progress on the research projects individually. This posed
a dilemma regarding cooperation on the ongoing research. Bringing in a team member at that stage, who was not involved
in the initial research process, could have resulted in inefficiencies, misalignment, and duplication of efforts.
Therefore, it was deemed more productive to continue working on the research independently, considering the progress
already made.

Moving forward, I recognize the importance of effective teamwork and collaboration in research projects. While
unforeseen circumstances can disrupt initial plans, it is essential to adapt and find alternative approaches to ensure
successful project completion. Reflecting on this experience, I will seek opportunities to foster effective
collaboration, communication, and cooperation in future research endeavors to leverage the benefits of diverse
perspectives and shared workload.
