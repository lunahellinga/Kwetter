## Test Plan

### Introduction

The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing approach for Kwetter, a social media platform,
focusing on ensuring the functionality, reliability, security, and performance of the system.

### Test Objectives

The objectives of the testing are as follows:

- Validate critical logic through unit testing using xUnit.
- Verify the integration between services using contract testing with Pact.
- Test end-to-end user journeys using Selenium.
- Conduct security testing using Snyk and AWS security scans to ensure the platform's security measures are effective.
- Perform load testing using k6 to assess the system's performance under various load conditions.

### Test Types and Techniques

a. Unit Testing:

- Target critical logic components and algorithms.
- Utilize xUnit framework for writing and executing unit tests.
- Test inputs, outputs, and expected behavior of individual units.

b. Integration Testing (Contract Testing):

- Focus on testing the interactions between different microservices.
- Employ Pact framework for contract testing.
- Validate that the services adhere to their defined contracts.

c. End-to-End Testing:

- Use Selenium to simulate user interactions and verify complete user journeys.
- Test various scenarios and user flows to ensure the system functions as expected.
- Verify the correctness of UI elements, navigation, and user inputs.

d. Security Testing:

- Conduct security testing using Snyk and AWS security scans, as well as SonarCloud's OWASP check.
- Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.
- Test for common security risks, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and authentication/authorization
  vulnerabilities.

e. Load Testing:

- Simulate realistic user loads using k6 to assess system performance under different conditions.
- Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization to identify performance bottlenecks.

### Test Environment

- Set up separate development and production environments for testing.
- Ensure the environments closely resemble the actual production environment, including infrastructure, databases,
  and dependencies.
- Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipelines to automate test execution.

### Test Execution and Reporting

- Develop test cases and test scripts based on the defined test types and techniques.
- Execute tests as part of the CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
- Record and report test results, including any defects or issues found during testing.
- Prioritize and track the resolution of identified issues based on ITIL incident management guidelines.
- Provide regular status updates and test reports to stakeholders.

### Test Coverage and Traceability

- Ensure comprehensive test coverage, covering critical functionalities and non-functional requirements.
- Establish traceability between test cases and the corresponding requirements or user stories.

### Test Sign-off and Acceptance

- Define criteria for test completion and acceptance.
- Conduct a formal sign-off process to ensure all test objectives have been met.

### Test Documentation

- Document test plans, test cases, and test scripts for future reference and knowledge transfer.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation that reflects changes and updates to the system.
