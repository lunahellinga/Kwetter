## Design

In designing Kwetter, I began by utilizing eventstorming and the requirements document as the first steps.
Eventstorming helped me gain an overview of the business areas and identify key events within the system, while the requirements document outlined the functional and non-functional aspects of the application.
With these foundations in place, I proceeded to create an initial architecture that aligned with the identified requirements.
As part of the iterative design process, I conducted research into various aspects of Kwetter, such as scalability, and used the insights gained from the research to refine and improve the architecture over time.
This iterative approach ensured that the architecture evolved to meet the specific needs and challenges of Kwetter.
