## Data Storage

Data storage solutions in Kwetter are chosen based on the specific functionalities and requirements of each service.
Here is an overview of the most suitable data storage solutions for different functionalities:

1. User and Session Management: User and session data, including profile information and authentication details, can be
   stored in a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   These databases provide ACID compliance and are well-suited for handling structured user data.
   Keycloak will require such a database to function.
2. Kweet Posting and Metadata Management: Metadata associated with Kweets, such as timestamps and user information, can
   be stored in a relational database.
   This ensures efficient querying and retrieval of metadata for Kweets.
   For user posts, a relational database can be used to store and manage the data.
   This allows for structured and organized storage of user-generated content.
3. Content Storage: Text and media attachments associated with Kweets can be stored in a distributed file storage system
   like Amazon S3 or a content delivery network (CDN).
   These solutions offer scalability, high availability, and optimized content delivery.
4. Caching: To improve the performance of high-traffic and recent Kweets, caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached can
   be employed.
   Caches store frequently accessed data in memory, allowing for faster retrieval and reducing the load on backend
   services.
5. Trend Data Storage: For storing trend data, a suitable solution would depend on factors such as data volume and
   performance requirements.
   Options include using a distributed database like Apache Cassandra or a data warehousing solution for efficient
   storage, analysis, and retrieval of trend data.
6. Interaction Data Storage: Data related to user interactions, such as replies, likes, shares, and user follows, can be
   stored in a relational or NoSQL database.
   The choice depends on factors such as the scale of interactions, the need for flexible schema, and performance
   requirements.

When selecting data storage solutions, considerations should include factors like scalability, performance, data
integrity, and query requirements.
It is crucial to assess the specific needs of each functionality and choose the appropriate data storage technology
accordingly.
This ensures that Kwetter's data is stored and retrieved efficiently, providing a reliable and responsive user
experience.
In order to achieve this, a separate research will be conducted into data storage solutions.
